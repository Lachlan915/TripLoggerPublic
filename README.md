# TripLoggerPublic

This repository is to showcase my work with OdometerLogger. 
I have a private repository with all the history to confirm my work. If you'd like to see it, feel free to message me. :)


Odometer Logger for Tax Purposes is being built with .NET Maui on Visual Studios and will be released on Android and iOS devices.

Future Updates:
 - Add a feature where users can add their car (number plate, car description, etc) and they can select it in a drop-down menu when creating a trip and in the view trips
 - Display the car's description after viewing the trips.
